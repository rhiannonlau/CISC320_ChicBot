<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The primary goal of this project is to develop an inventory management system tailored for small to medium-sized businesses in the clothing industry. This system will allow businesses to efficiently manage their inventory while providing a seamless interface for customer interaction. One of the core features of the system is a chatbot named Chick, powered by a large language model (LLM), which will assist customers by answering questions related to the available inventory and offering personalized clothing recommendations based on customer preferences. The chatbot enhances user experience by streamlining customer interactions and enabling real-time responses to queries, which reduces the time customers spend searching for desired products. This system not only simplifies inventory management but also facilitates better customer engagement, ultimately driving more efficient purchases and increasing business revenue through optimized interactions.</p>
